# The Silver Case / The 25th Ward Chapter Text Editor
 
 This node application allows to load a Silver Case script/message JSON, modify and download it.

 It reads the `dic` and `stringDic` properties in the JSON, parses their keys and reads the messageEN and messageJP properties to display them and be able to modify them.

 ``npm run install``

 ``npm run dev`` to run a local server.

 ``npm run build`` to build a production ready application.
