# The Silver Case / The 25th Ward Chapter Text Editor
 
 This node application allows to load a Silver Case script/message JSON, modify and download it.

 It reads the `dic` and `stringDic` properties in the JSON, parses their keys and reads the messageEN and messageJP properties to display them and be able to modify them.

 This is a NodeJS / Vite application. You must open the project in VSCode preferably and with a shell opened in the main directory, execute the following commands:

 ``npm install``

 ``npm run dev`` to run a local server. [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/)

 ``npm run build`` to build a production ready application.
